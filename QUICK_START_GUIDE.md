- **Advanced Assays**: RT-QuIC, SAA, seeding assays (Projects 172, 173, 207)

### ✅ Clinical Integration  
- **MDS-UPDRS Scores**: Part III motor scores, bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor subscores
- **Statistical Testing**: Mann-Whitney U tests, Pearson correlations with significance testing
- **Data Quality Metrics**: Missing value reporting, sample size tracking

## 📈 Data Overview

**Successfully Loaded:**
- **36,775 biomarker records** from 2,114 unique patients
- **256 unique biomarker tests** including key α-syn, tau, Aβ markers
- **Complete demographics** for 7,489 patients
- **34,628 UPDRS motor assessment** records
- **6,265 genetic profiles** with APOE, LRRK2, GBA variants

**Key Statistics:**
- **Healthy Controls (HC)**: 208 patients, 9,059 biomarker records
- **Parkinson's Disease (PD)**: 702 patients, 19,282 biomarker records  
- **Prodromal PD**: 6,585 biomarker records
- **High Genetic Risk**: 9,530 records with pathogenic variants

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Start with Biomarker Levels Tab**
   - Select a biomarker (e.g., "CSF Alpha-synuclein")
   - Compare levels across HC, PD, Prodromal PD groups
   - Review statistical significance tests

2. **Explore Longitudinal Changes**
   - View age-related biomarker trends
   - Check correlations with age by diagnostic group
   - Identify progression patterns

3. **Analyze Correlations**
   - Plot biomarker-to-biomarker relationships
   - Correlate biomarkers with UPDRS motor scores
   - Use scatter plots with regression lines

4. **Use Interactive Heatmaps**  
   - View comprehensive correlation matrices
   - Include multiple biomarkers and clinical scores
   - Identify complex relationship patterns

5. **Apply Filters for Subgroup Analysis**
   - Filter by age ranges, sex, genetic risk
   - Focus on specific patient populations
   - Compare high-risk vs standard-risk groups

## 🔬 Scientific Applications

### Research Questions You Can Answer:
- **Biomarker Discrimination**: Do CSF α-syn levels distinguish PD from HC?
- **Progression Markers**: Which biomarkers correlate with motor symptom severity?
- **Genetic Modulation**: Do APOE/LRRK2 variants affect biomarker levels?
- **Multi-marker Patterns**: How do α-syn, tau, and Aβ correlate in PD?
- **Prodromal Detection**: Can biomarkers identify at-risk individuals?

### Statistical Methods Included:
- Non-parametric group comparisons (Mann-Whitney U)
- Linear regression with confidence intervals
- Pearson correlation analysis with significance testing
- Multiple biomarker correlation matrices
- Age-adjusted trend analysis

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard Won't Start:
1. **Check Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Run Tests**: Execute `python test_dashboard.py`
3. **Verify Data**: Ensure all CSV files are in correct locations
4. **Check Ports**: Try different port with `--server.port 8502`

### For Performance Issues:
1. **Apply Filters**: Reduce data size with demographic/genetic filters
2. **Focus on Key Biomarkers**: Use main biomarkers for faster loading
3. **Clear Cache**: Use Streamlit's "Clear cache" option

### For Analysis Questions:
1. **Check Sample Sizes**: Use Data Summary tab to verify adequate data
2. **Review Missing Values**: Check data quality metrics
3. **Validate Results**: Cross-reference with published PPMI findings

## 📚 Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements:
- **Add medication analysis**: Include dopaminergic medication effects
- **Incorporate cognitive scores**: Add MoCA, neuropsychological tests
- **Advanced statistics**: Machine learning classification models
- **Export capabilities**: PDF report generation, data export features
- **Survival analysis**: Time-to-event progression modeling

### Publication Guidelines:
- Follow PPMI Data Use Agreement requirements
