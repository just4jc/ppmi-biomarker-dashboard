# Large File Handling - Current Biospecimen Analysis Results

## File Details
- **Original File**: `Current_Biospecimen_Analysis_Results_18Sep2025.csv`  
- **Original Size**: 153 MB (exceeds GitHub's 100MB limit)
- **Compressed File**: `Current_Biospecimen_Analysis_Results_18Sep2025.csv.gz`
- **Compressed Size**: 8.6 MB âœ…
- **Status**: âœ… Compressed version uploaded to GitHub repository

## Current Status
âœ… **RESOLVED**: The file has been compressed from 153MB to 8.6MB and is now included in the repository. The dashboard automatically handles both compressed and uncompressed versions.

## Available Alternatives
1. **Pilot Biospecimen Analysis Results**: Available in repo
2. **SAA Biospecimen Analysis Results**: Available in repo  
3. **All Clinical and Genetic Data**: Available in repo

## For Dashboard Usage
The Streamlit dashboard supports file upload functionality, so users can:

1. **Local Development**: Place the large CSV file in the `Biospecimen Analysis Results` folder
2. **Cloud Deployment**: Upload the file directly through the Streamlit interface
3. **Alternative Analysis**: Use the smaller Pilot and SAA datasets for initial analysis

## Future Solutions
To include the large file in the repository, consider:

1. **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**:
   ```bash
   # Install Git LFS (requires admin access)
   brew install git-lfs  # macOS
   
   # Initialize LFS in repo
   git lfs install
   
   # Track large CSV files
   git lfs track "*.csv"
   git lfs track "**/*_Results_*.csv"
   
   # Add and commit
   git add .gitattributes
   git add "Biospecimen Analysis Results (The Biomarkers We're Focusing On)/Current_Biospecimen_Analysis_Results_18Sep2025.csv"
   git commit -m "Add large biospecimen file via Git LFS"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **File Compression**: Compress to ZIP format (may reduce size below 100MB)

3. **Data Sampling**: Create a representative sample of the large dataset

## Repository Contents âœ…
**ALL** essential datasets have been uploaded:
- âœ… Demographics and patient information  
- âœ… Clinical diagnosis data
- âœ… Genetic data (APOE, variants, risk scores)
- âœ… Motor assessments (MDS-UPDRS I-IV)
- âœ… Non-motor assessments (cognitive, sleep, autonomic)
- âœ… Pilot and SAA biospecimen results
- âœ… **Current biospecimen results (compressed: 8.6MB)** ðŸŽ‰
- âœ… Updated Streamlit dashboard code
- âœ… Data loader handles compressed files automatically

The dashboard is now fully functional with ALL uploaded datasets including the complete biospecimen analysis!
